'''''Minecraft''''' is a 2011 [[sandbox game]] developed and published by Swedish video game developer [[Mojang Studios]]. Originally created by [[Markus "Notch" Persson]] using the [[Java (programming language)|Java]] [[programming language]], the first [[public alpha]] build was released on 17 May 2009. The game was continuously developed from then on, receiving a full release on 18 November 2011. Afterwards, Persson left Mojang and gave [[Jens "Jeb" Bergensten]] control over development. In the years since its release, it has been [[Video game port|ported]] to several platforms, including smartphones, tablets, and various [[video game console]]s. In 2014, Mojang and the ''Minecraft'' intellectual property were purchased by [[Microsoft]] for {{US$|2.5}} billion. ''Minecraft'' is the [[List of best-selling video games|best-selling video game of all time]], with over 300 million copies sold and nearly 170 million monthly [[active players]] as of 2024.

In ''Minecraft'', players explore a [[procedurally generated]], [[three-dimensional]] world with virtually infinite terrain made up of [[voxel]]s. Players can discover and extract raw materials, [[Glossary of video game terms#Crafting|craft]] tools and items, and build structures, [[Earthworks (engineering)|earthwork]]s, and machines. Depending on their chosen [[Game mechanics|game mode]], players can fight hostile [[Mob (video games)|mob]]s, as well as cooperate with or compete against other players in [[multiplayer]]. The game has two main modes: [[Survival game|survival mode]], where players must acquire resources to survive, and a creative mode where players have unlimited resources and the ability to fly. Other game modes exist, such as one that allows players to spectate others and one that plays identically to survival mode, but features [[permadeath]]. The game's large community offers a wide variety of [[user-generated content]], such as [[Minecraft modding|modification]]s, [[Minecraft server|server]]s, [[Theme (computing)#Video gaming|skin]]s, [[texture pack]]s, and custom maps, which add new [[game mechanics]] and possibilities.

''Minecraft'' has received critical acclaim, winning several awards and being cited as one of the [[greatest video games of all time]]; social media, [[parodies]], adaptations, [[merchandise]], and the annual [[Minecon]] conventions played prominent roles in popularizing the game. ''Minecraft'' has been used in educational environments to teach chemistry, [[computer-aided design]], and [[computer science]]. The game started [[Minecraft (franchise)|a franchise]], which includes several spin-off games including ''[[Minecraft: Story Mode]]'', ''[[Minecraft Earth]]'', ''[[Minecraft Dungeons]]'', and ''[[Minecraft Legends]]''. A [[live action]] film based on the game titled ''[[A Minecraft Movie]]'' is scheduled for theatrical release in April 2025.

The Nether is a [[hell]]-like underworld dimension accessed via a player-built obsidian portal; newer versions of the game feature naturally generated damaged portals that the player can repair.<ref>{{Cite web |date=23 June 2023 |title=Minecraft Nether portal dimensions and calculator |url=https://www.pcgamesn.com/minecraft/nether-portal-dimensions |access-date=5 July 2024 |website=PCGamesN |language=en-US}}</ref> The Nether contains many unique resources and can be used to travel great distances in the Overworld, due to every block traveled in the Nether being equivalent to 8 blocks traveled in the Overworld.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Francis |first=Tom |date=10 October 2010 |title=A clearer look at Minecraft's new hell dimension |url=http://www.pcgamer.com/previews/a-clearer-look-at-minecrafts-new-hell-dimension/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101113601/http://www.pcgamer.com/previews/a-clearer-look-at-minecrafts-new-hell-dimension/ |archive-date=1 November 2012 |access-date=30 October 2012 |publisher=[[Future plc]] |magazine=[[PC Gamer]]}}</ref> Mobs that populate the Nether include shrieking, fireball-shooting ghasts, alongside anthropomorphic mobs called piglins and their zombified counterparts.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Geere |first=Duncan |date=11 October 2019 |title=Visit the Nether! |url=https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/visit-nether- |access-date=12 October 2022 |website=The Minecraft Official Site |series=Deep Dives |publisher=Microsoft |archive-date=12 October 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221012174721/https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/visit-nether- |url-status=live }}</ref> The piglins in particular have a [[bartering]] system, where players can give them gold ingots and receive items in return.<ref>{{cite web|last=Marshall|first=Cass|date=1 July 2020|title=Everybody loves Minecraft's new Piglin, the rudest new NPCs|website=Polygon|url=https://www.polygon.com/2020/7/1/21310370/minecraft-nether-update-piglin-fan-reaction-trading-gold-looting|access-date=22 September 2023|archive-date=3 October 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231003222747/https://www.polygon.com/2020/7/1/21310370/minecraft-nether-update-piglin-fan-reaction-trading-gold-looting|url-status=live}}</ref> The player can also build an optional [[Boss (video games)|boss]] mob called The Wither out of materials found in the Nether.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Staff |first1=Mojang AB (Firm) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jrb4MAAACAAJ&q=guide+to+nether+and+the+end |title=Minecraft Guide to the Nether and the End |last2=Milton |first2=Stephanie |date=1 September 2017 |publisher=Egmont UK Limited |isbn=978-1-4052-8599-5 |pages=32–33 |access-date=29 December 2017 |via=Google Books |archive-date=5 May 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240505020425/https://books.google.com/books?id=Jrb4MAAACAAJ&q=guide+to+nether+and+the+end |url-status=live }}</ref>

==== The End ====
The End can be reached through an end portal, consisting of twelve end portal frames. End portals are found in underground structures in the Overworld known as strongholds. To find strongholds, players must craft eyes of ender using an ender pearl and blaze powder. Eyes of ender can then be thrown, traveling in the direction of the stronghold. Once the player reaches the stronghold, they can place eyes of ender into each portal frame to activate the end portal.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2011-12-18 |title=The End - Minecraft Guide |url=https://www.ign.com/wikis/minecraft/The_End |access-date=2025-02-19 |website=IGN |language=en}}</ref> The dimension consists of islands floating in a dark, bottomless void.

=== Game modes ===
==== Survival mode ====

In survival mode, players have to gather natural resources such as wood and stone found in the environment in order to craft certain blocks and items.<ref name="Beginner's guide" /> Depending on the difficulty, monsters spawn in darker areas outside a certain radius of the character, requiring players to build a shelter in order to survive at night.<ref name="Beginner's guide" /> The mode also has a [[Health (game terminology)|health bar]] which is depleted by attacks from mobs, falls, drowning, falling into lava, suffocation, starvation, and other events. Players also have a hunger bar, which must be periodically refilled by eating food in-game unless the player is playing on peaceful difficulty.<ref name=":8">{{Cite web |last=Lee |first=Julia |date=20 August 2020 |title=How to regain health in Minecraft |url=https://www.polygon.com/2020/8/20/21373772/how-to-regain-health-hp-food-potions |access-date=26 July 2021 |website=Polygon |language=en |archive-date=26 July 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210726120127/https://www.polygon.com/2020/8/20/21373772/how-to-regain-health-hp-food-potions |url-status=live }}</ref> If the hunger bar is empty, automatic healing stops and depletes. Health replenishes when players have a full hunger bar or continuously on peaceful.<ref name=":8" />

Upon losing all health, items in the players' inventories are dropped unless the game is reconfigured not to do so. Players then re-spawn at their spawn point, which by default is where players first spawn in the game and can be reset by sleeping in a bed<ref>{{Cite news |last=Walker |first=John |date=18 February 2011 |title=Minecraft Is Getting Ready For Bed |work=[[Rock Paper Shotgun]] |url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/02/18/minecraft-is-getting-ready-for-bed/ |url-status=live |access-date=2 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109010753/http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/02/18/minecraft-is-getting-ready-for-bed/ |archive-date=9 November 2012}}</ref> or using a respawn anchor.<ref>{{Cite web |last=James |first=Ford |date=30 June 2020 |title=Minecraft Respawn Anchor: How to get one and set your spawn point in the Nether |url=https://www.gamesradar.com/minecraft-respawn-anchor/ |access-date=10 August 2020 |website=gamesradar |language=en |archive-date=22 November 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201122110123/https://www.gamesradar.com/minecraft-respawn-anchor/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Dropped items can be recovered if players can reach them before they disappear or despawn after 5 minutes.

Enchanted items are generally more powerful, last longer, or have other special effects.<ref name=":11" />

The game features two more game modes based on survival, known as "hardcore mode" and "adventure mode". Hardcore mode plays identically to survival mode, but features [[permadeath]], meaning players only have one life, forcing them to delete the world or explore it as a spectator after death.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Senior |first=Tom |date=23 September 2011 |title=Minecraft hardcore mode teased.

Modifications of the ''Minecraft'' code, called ''[[Video game modding|mods]]'', add a variety of gameplay changes, ranging from new blocks, items, and mobs to entire arrays of mechanisms.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Peckham |first=Matt |date=8 May 2012 |title=The 10 Best Minecraft Mods |url=https://techland.time.com/2012/05/08/the-10-best-minecraft-mods/ |url-status=live |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030095454/http://techland.time.com/2012/05/08/the-10-best-minecraft-mods/ |archive-date=30 October 2012 |access-date=28 October 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Senior |first=Tom |date=29 February 2012 |title=Minecraft mod API to be developed by new team at Mojang |url=http://www.pcgamer.com/2012/02/29/minecraft-mod-api-to-be-developed-by-new-team-at-mojang/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130203114102/http://www.pcgamer.com/2012/02/29/minecraft-mod-api-to-be-developed-by-new-team-at-mojang/ |archive-date=3 February 2013 |access-date=28 October 2012 |publisher=[[Future plc]] |magazine=[[PC Gamer]]}}</ref> The modding community is responsible for a substantial supply of mods from ones that enhance gameplay, such as [[mini-map]]s, waypoints, and durability counters, to ones that add to the game elements from other video games and media.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-09-27 |title=The 56 best Minecraft mods September 2024 |url=https://www.pcgamesn.com/minecraft/twenty-best-minecraft-mods |access-date=2024-09-28 |website=PCGamesN |language=en-US}}</ref> While a variety of mod frameworks were independently developed by [[reverse engineering]] the code, Mojang has also enhanced [[Vanilla software|vanilla]] ''Minecraft'' with official frameworks for modification, allowing the production of community-created resource packs, which alter certain game elements including textures and sounds.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Dyer |first=Mitch |date=4 July 2013 |title=Minecraft 1.6 'Horse Update' Launching in July |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/06/25/minecraft-16-horse-update-launching-in-july |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130708124020/http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/06/25/minecraft-16-horse-update-launching-in-july |archive-date=8 July 2013 |publisher=IGN}}</ref> Players can also create their own "maps" (custom world save files) that often contain specific rules, challenges, puzzles and quests, and share them for others to play.<ref name="Savage 2012">{{Cite web |last=Savage |first=Phil |title=The 25 best Minecraft custom maps |url=http://www.pcgamer.com/2012/10/20/the-25-best-minecraft-custom-maps/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023211322/http://www.pcgamer.com/2012/10/20/the-25-best-minecraft-custom-maps/ |archive-date=23 October 2012 |access-date=28 October 2012 |publisher=[[Future plc]] |magazine=[[PC Gamer]]}}</ref> Mojang added an adventure mode in August 2012<ref name="RPS – 1.3july">{{Cite news |last=Grayson |first=Nathan |date=6 July 2012 |title=Minecraft 1.3 Adding LAN, Adventure Mode In August |work=[[Rock Paper Shotgun]] |url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/07/06/minecraft-1-3-adding-lan-adventure-mode-in-august/ |url-status=live |access-date=4 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112203224/http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/07/06/minecraft-1-3-adding-lan-adventure-mode-in-august/ |archive-date=12 November 2012}}</ref> and "command blocks" in October 2012,<ref name="Gallegos">{{Cite web |last=Gallegos |first=Anthony |date=27 July 2012 |title=Minecraft Adding New Block |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/07/27/minecraft-adding-new-block |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121216094902/http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/07/27/minecraft-adding-new-block |archive-date=16 December 2012 |access-date=28 October 2012 |website=[[IGN]]}}</ref> which were created specially for custom maps in ''Java Edition''.

For the tenth anniversary of the first public build's release, Mojang remade a version of ''Minecraft Classic'' in [[JavaScript]] and made it available to play online.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://classic.minecraft.net/ |title=Minecraft Classic |website=classic.minecraft.net |access-date=21 December 2019 |archive-date=8 February 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210208170844/https://classic.minecraft.net/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Abent |first=Eric |date=9 May 2019 |title=Minecraft Classic can now be played in your web browser |url=https://www.slashgear.com/minecraft-classic-can-now-be-played-in-your-web-browser-09576106/ |access-date=1 March 2022 |website=slashgear.com |archive-date=29 March 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230329173018/https://www.slashgear.com/minecraft-classic-can-now-be-played-in-your-web-browser-09576106/ |url-status=live }}</ref> It functions much the same as creative mode, allowing players to build and destroy any and all parts of the world either alone or in a multiplayer server.

Around 2011, prior to ''Minecraft''{{'}}s full release, there had been collaboration between Mojang and [[The Lego Group]] to make a [[Lego]] brick-based ''Minecraft'' game to be called ''Brickcraft''. This would have modified the base ''Minecraft'' game to use Lego bricks, which meant adapting the basic 1×1 block to account for larger pieces typically used in Lego sets. Persson had worked on the preliminary version of this game, which he had named "Project Rex Kwon Do" based on the joke from ''[[Napoleon Dynamite]]''. Lego had greenlit the project to go forward, and while Mojang had put two developers on the game for six months, they later opted to cancel the project, as Mojang felt that the Lego Group were too demanding on what they could do, according to Mojang's Daniel Kaplan. The Lego Group had considered buying out Mojang to complete the game, but at this point Microsoft made its offer to buy the company for over $2 billion. According to the Lego Group's Ronny Scherer, the company was not yet sure of the potential success of ''Minecraft'' at this point and backed off from acquisition after Microsoft brought this offer to Mojang.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/the-lego-minecraft-videogame-brickcraft-that-was-greenlit-and-why-it-never-happened/ |title=A Lego Minecraft game called 'Brickcraft' was prototyped and greenlit – here's why it never happened |first=Rich |last=Stanton |date=9 December 2020 |access-date=9 December 2020 |work=[[PC Gamer]] |archive-date=9 December 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201209155302/https://www.pcgamer.com/the-lego-minecraft-videogame-brickcraft-that-was-greenlit-and-why-it-never-happened/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

==== Virtual reality ====
Early on, Persson planned to support the [[Oculus Rift]] with a port of ''Minecraft''. However, after Facebook acquired Oculus in 2013, he abruptly canceled plans noting "Facebook creeps me out."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Webster |first1=Andrew |title='Minecraft' creator cancels Oculus Rift version following Facebook acquisition |url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/3/25/5547626/minecraft-oculus-vr-cancelled |website=The Verge |access-date=14 September 2017 |date=25 March 2014 |archive-date=10 May 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180510054553/https://www.theverge.com/2014/3/25/5547626/minecraft-oculus-vr-cancelled |url-status=live }}</ref> A community-made modification known as ''Minecraft VR'' was developed in 2016 to provide virtual reality support to ''Minecraft: Java Edition'' oriented toward Oculus Rift hardware.

''Minecraft''{{'s}} music and sound effects were produced by German musician Daniel Rosenfeld, better known as [[C418]].<ref name="credits">{{cite web |url=https://minecraft.net/game/credits |title=Minecraft.net Credits |website=Mojang |access-date=1 January 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121226231247/http://minecraft.net/game/credits |archive-date=26 December 2012}}</ref> To create the sound effects for the game, Rosenfeld made extensive use of [[foley (filmmaking)|foley]] techniques. On learning the processes for the game, he remarked, "Foley’s an interesting thing, and I had to learn its subtleties. Early on, I wasn’t that knowledgeable about it. It’s a whole trial-and-error process. You just make a sound and eventually you go, 'Oh my God, that’s it! Get the microphone!' There’s no set way of doing anything at all."<ref name="FACT2">{{Cite magazine |date=5 September 2015 |title=Can You Dig It: FACT meets Minecraft composer C418 |url=http://www.factmag.com/2015/09/05/minecraft-c418-interview/ |access-date=21 March 2018 |magazine=[[Fact (UK magazine)|Fact]] |archive-date=30 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180630161810/http://www.factmag.com/2015/09/05/minecraft-c418-interview/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="redbull">{{Cite web |last=Burns |first=Todd L |date=21 August 2015 |title=Interview: Minecraft's Soundtrack Composer C418 |url=https://daily.redbullmusicacademy.com/2015/08/c418-interview |access-date=2 April 2023 |website=Red Bull Music Academy |language=en |archive-date=2 April 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230402013327/https://daily.redbullmusicacademy.com/2015/08/c418-interview/ |url-status=live }}</ref> He reminisced on creating the in-game sound for grass blocks, stating "It turns out that to make grass sounds you don’t actually walk on grass and record it, because grass sounds like nothing. What you want to do is get a VHS, break it apart, and just lightly touch the tape." According to Rosenfeld, his favorite sound to design for the game was the hisses of [[spiders]]. He elaborates, "I like the spiders. Recording that was a whole day of me researching what a spider sounds like. Turns out, there are spiders that make little screeching sounds, so I think I got this recording of a fire hose, put it in a sampler, and just pitched it around until it sounded like a weird spider was talking to you."<ref name="FACT2" />

Many sounds for the game were created accidentally or spontaneously. On the creation for the sound for the creeper, Rosenfeld recalled, "That was just a complete accident by Markus and me {{sic}}. We just put in a placeholder sound of burning a matchstick. It seemed to work hilariously well, so we kept it."<ref name="TheGuardian">{{Cite web |last=Keith |first=Stuart |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/nov/07/how-daniel-rosenfeld-wrote-minecraft-music |title=How Daniel Rosenfeld wrote Minecraft's music |date=7 November 2014 |website=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=28 February 2024 |archive-date=6 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170106014049/https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/nov/07/how-daniel-rosenfeld-wrote-minecraft-music |url-status=live }}</ref> On other sounds, such as those of the zombie, Rosenfeld remarked, "I actually never wanted the zombies so scary. I intentionally made them sound comical. It’s nice to hear that they work so well [...]."<ref name="TheGuardian" /> Rosenfeld remarked that the sound engine was "terrible" to work with, remembering "If you had two song files at once, it [the game engine] would actually crash. There were so many more weird [[Video game glitch|glitches]] like that the guys never really fixed because they were too busy with the actual game and not the sound engine."<ref name="redbull"/>

The [[background music]] in ''Minecraft'' is instrumental [[ambient music]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=29 June 2015 |title=Minecraft's Composer Explains Why the Music Is 'So Weird' |url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/d73q5a/minecrafts-composer-explains-why-the-music-is-so-weird |access-date=9 August 2020 |website=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] |language=en |archive-date=16 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200416160218/https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/d73q5a/minecrafts-composer-explains-why-the-music-is-so-weird |url-status=live }}</ref> To compose the music of ''Minecraft'', Rosenfeld used the package from [[Ableton Live]], along with several additional plug-ins. Speaking on them, Rosenfeld said "They can be pretty much everything from an effect to an entire orchestra. Additionally, I’ve got some synthesizers that are attached to the computer.

The last update Rosenfeld worked on was Update Aquatic. His music remained the only music in the game until 2020's "The Nether Update", introducing pieces from [[Lena Raine]]. Since then, other composers have made contributions, including [[Kumi Tanioka]], Samuel Åberg, and Aaron Cherof, with Raine remaining as the new primary composer. Ownership of all music besides Rosenfeld's independently released albums has been retained by Microsoft, with their label publishing all of the other artists' releases.

=== Controversies ===

==== 2014 EULA changes ====
Microsoft and Mojang announced in June 2014 that it would be changing the ''Minecraft'' [[end-user license agreement]] (EULA) to prohibit servers from accepting donations or payments in exchange for the donating or paying players receiving in-game advantages on such server, essentially banning "[[pay-to-win]]" servers. Mojang spokesperson Owen Hill provided examples of what it would and would not allow, saying company would allow for pay-to-play servers in which a player is required to pay a fee to access the server, or for cosmetic enhancements (such as in-game costumes or pets), but that Mojang would be cracking down on paying to obtain powerful swords or potions (providing a competitive advantage to the player versus other players). The new crackdowns were supported by Persson, citing him receiving multiple emails from parents of children who had spent hundreds of dollars on servers. The ''Minecraft'' community and server owners, however, heavily despised the new change in enforcement and protested en masse, which included comparing Mojang to monolithic video game publishers like [[Electronic Arts]] and [[Activision]], gaming companies often criticized online for their highly restrictive digital rights management and user license agreements. Many argued that the crackdown would force smaller servers to close their doors, and some blamed the crackdown on Mojang attempting to suppress competition for its own ''Minecraft Realms'' subscription service.<ref>{{Cite news |date=24 June 2014 |title=Minecraft: how a change to the rules is tearing the community apart |website=[[The Guardian]] |url=http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/24/minecraft-how-a-change-to-the-rules-is-tearing-the-community-apart |access-date=15 July 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220715224605/https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/24/minecraft-how-a-change-to-the-rules-is-tearing-the-community-apart |archive-date=15 July 2022}}</ref>

==== Account migration ====
In 2020, Mojang Studios revealed that it would begin the process of requiring that [[Microsoft account]]s be used in order to log into the ''Java Edition'' of the game, and that older Mojang Studios accounts would be sunsetted. The move to Microsoft accounts also required ''Java Edition'' players to create [[Xbox network]] Gamertags. Mojang Studios defended the move to Microsoft accounts by saying that improved security could be offered, which included Java accounts being able to use [[two factor authentication]], players could block cyberbullies in chat, and improve parental controls. The community responded with intense backlash against this announcement, particularly taking issue to the various technical difficulties encountered in the process and how account migration would be mandatory, even for those who do not play on servers. As of 10 March 2022, Microsoft required that all players migrate in order to access the ''Java Edition'' of ''Minecraft''.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Coles |first=Jason |date=14 March 2022 |title=Microsoft's Minecraft migration meets a mixed response |url=https://www.pcgamesn.com/minecraft/account-migration |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220715032422/https://www.pcgamesn.com/minecraft/account-migration |archive-date=15 July 2022 |access-date=15 July 2022 |website=[[PCGamesN]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Rich |first=Rob |date=10 February 2022 |title=Microsoft Gives Minecraft: Java Edition Players A Deadline To Migrate Accounts |url=https://www.slashgear.com/764466/microsoft-gives-minecraft-java-edition-players-a-deadline-to-migrate-accounts/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220715032421/https://www.slashgear.com/764466/microsoft-gives-minecraft-java-edition-players-a-deadline-to-migrate-accounts/ |archive-date=15 July 2022 |access-date=15 July 2022 |website=SlashGear }}</ref> A deadline of 19 September 2023 was announced to complete account migration, after which all legacy Mojang accounts became inaccessible and unable to be migrated.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Mojang Account migration completed |url=https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/account-migration-last-call |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230919182110/https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/account-migration-last-call |archive-date=19 September 2023 |access-date=20 September 2023 |website=Minecraft.net}}</ref>

==== ''Java Edition'' chat reporting ====
In June 2022, Microsoft and Mojang Studios announced it would be releasing a player reporting feature in all future builds of ''Java Edition''. In earlier development builds, players could report other players on multiplayer servers for sending messages that are prohibited by the Xbox Live Code of Conduct; report categories included profane language, substance abuse, hate speech, threats of violence, and nudity, though Microsoft in later builds has since excluded the profane language category from the player reporting feature. If a player was found to be in violation of Xbox Community Standards, the player would be banned from all servers for a specific period of time or permanently.

==== Mob Vote ====
The "Mob Vote" was an online event organized by Mojang in which the ''Minecraft'' community voted between three original mob concepts; the winning mob was officially implemented in a future update, while the losing mobs were scrapped, though elements of them would sometimes return in later updates as separate features. The first Mob Vote was held during [[Minecon|MINECON Earth 2017]] and became an annual event starting with [[Minecraft Live|Minecraft Live 2020]]. The Mob Vote was often criticized for forcing players to choose one mob instead of implementing all three, causing divisions and [[Flaming (Internet)|flaming]] within the community, and potentially allowing [[internet bot]]s and ''Minecraft'' content creators with large fanbases to conduct [[vote brigading]].<ref name=":7">{{Cite news |last=Chalk |first=Andy |date=10 October 2023 |title=Minecraft players go full propaganda mode as petition demanding the end of the 'mob vote' draws 300,000 signatures in just a few days |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/minecraft-players-go-full-propaganda-mode-as-petition-demanding-the-end-of-the-mob-vote-draws-300000-signatures-in-just-a-few-days/ |access-date=27 July 2024 |work=PC Gamer |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Currier |first=Sarah |title=After a proposed boycott, Minecraft mob vote faces more controversy in wake of rigging accusations |url=https://iowastatedaily.com/283322/limelight/after-a-proposed-boycott-minecraft-mob-vote-faces-even-more-controversy-in-wake-of-rigging-accusations-iowa-state-university-sarah-currier/ |access-date=27 July 2024 |website=Iowa State Daily}}</ref> The Mob Vote was also blamed for a perceived lack of new content added to ''Minecraft'' since Microsoft's acquisition of Mojang in 2014.<ref name=":7" />

The 2023 Mob Vote featured three passive mobs—the crab, the penguin, and the armadillo—with voting scheduled to start on 13 October.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Sophie |first=Austine |date=13 September 2023 |title=MINECRAFT LIVE IS BACK |url=https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-live-2023-announcement |access-date=28 June 2024 |website=Minecraft.net}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Wood |first=Martin |date=8 October 2023 |title=Minecraft's 2023 Mob Vote Explained |url=https://gamerant.com/minecraft-2023-mob-vote-explained/ |access-date=27 July 2024 |website=Game Rant |language=en}}</ref>
In response, a [[Change.org]] petition was created on 6 October, demanding that Mojang eliminate the Mob Vote and instead implement all three mobs going forward. The petition received approximately 445,000 signatures by 13 October<ref>{{Cite web |last=Baker |first=Savannah |date=17 October 2023 |title=Minecraft players boycott the Mob Vote |url=https://umlconnector.com/2023/10/minecraft-players-boycott-the-mob-vote/ |access-date=27 July 2024 |website=The UMass Lowell Connector |language=en-US}}</ref> and was joined by calls to [[boycott]] the Mob Vote, as well as a partially-tongue-in-cheek "revolutionary" [[propaganda]] campaign in which sympathizers created anti-Mojang and pro-boycott posters in the vein of real 20th century propaganda posters.<ref name=":7" /><ref>{{Cite web |last=Dalton |first=Cooper |date=9 October 2023 |title=Petition to End the Minecraft Mob Vote is Blowing Up |url=https://gamerant.com/minecraft-mob-vote-2023-petition-boycott/ |access-date=28 June 2023 |website=Game Rant}}</ref> Mojang did not release an official response to the boycott and the Mob Vote otherwise proceeded normally, with the armadillo winning the vote.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Austin |first=Sophie |date=15 October 2023 |title=Minecraft Live 2023: The Recap! |url=https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-live-2023--the-recap- |access-date=27 July 2024 |website=Minecraft.net}}</ref> In September 2024, as part of a blog post detailing their future plans for ''Minecraft''<nowiki/>'s development, Mojang announced the Mob Vote would be retired.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Cooper |first=Ryan |date=9 September 2024 |title=The future of Minecraft's development |url=https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/the-future-of-minecrafts-development |access-date=9 September 2024 |website=Minecraft}}</ref>

=== Applications ===
The possible applications of ''Minecraft'' have been discussed extensively, especially in the fields of [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) and education. In a panel at Minecon 2011, a Swedish developer discussed the possibility of using the game to redesign public buildings and parks, stating that rendering using ''Minecraft'' was much more user-friendly for the community, making it easier to envision the functionality of new buildings and parks.<ref name=salon /> In 2012, a member of the [[Human Dynamics]] group at the [[MIT Media Lab]], Cody Sumter, said: "Notch hasn't just built a game. He's tricked 40 million people into learning to use a CAD program." Various software has been developed to allow virtual designs to be printed using professional [[3D printing|3D printers]] or personal printers such as [[MakerBot]] and [[RepRap]].<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Cheshire |first=Tom |title=Want to learn computer-aided design (CAD)?

Using ''Minecraft'', the community has helped reconstruct the areas of concern, and citizens are invited to enter the ''Minecraft'' servers and modify their own neighborhood. Carl Manneh, Mojang's managing director, called the game "the perfect tool to facilitate this process", adding "The three-year partnership will support UN-Habitat's Sustainable Urban Development Network to upgrade 300 public spaces by 2016." Mojang signed ''Minecraft'' building community, ''FyreUK'', to help render the environments into ''Minecraft''. The first pilot project began in [[Kibera]], one of [[Nairobi]]'s informal settlements and is in the planning phase. The ''Block by Block'' project is based on an earlier initiative started in October 2011, ''Mina Kvarter'' (My Block), which gave young people in Swedish communities a tool to visualize how they wanted to change their part of town. According to Manneh, the project was a helpful way to visualize urban planning ideas without necessarily having a training in architecture.

Despite its unpredictable nature, ''Minecraft'' has become a popular game for [[speedrunning]], where players time themselves from being dropped into a new world to reaching The End and defeating the Ender Dragon boss.

''Minecraft'' has also been used in educational settings.<ref name="Minecraft In Education" /> In 2011, an educational organization named MinecraftEdu was formed with the goal of introducing ''Minecraft'' into schools. The group works with Mojang to make the game affordable and accessible to schools.

=== Clones ===
Following the initial surge in popularity of ''Minecraft'' in 2010, other video games were criticised for having various similarities to ''Minecraft'', and some were described as being "[[Video game clone|clones]]", often due to a direct inspiration from ''Minecraft'', or a superficial similarity. Examples include ''[[Ace of Spades (video game)|Ace of Spades]]'', ''[[CastleMiner]]'', ''CraftWorld'', ''[[FortressCraft]]'', ''[[Terraria]]'', ''BlockWorld 3D'', ''Total Miner'',<ref>{{cite web
