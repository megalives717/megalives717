'''Roblox''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|oʊ|b|l|ɒ|k|s|audio=LL-Q1860 (eng)-Flame, not lame-Roblox.wav}}, {{respell|ROH|bloks}}) is an [[online game]] [[Computing platform|platform]] and [[game creation system]] developed by [[Roblox Corporation]] that allows users to [[Computer programming|program]] and play games created by themselves or other users. It was created by [[David Baszucki]] and Erik Cassel in 2004, and released to the public in 2006. As of August 2020, the platform has over 164 million monthly active users, including half of all American children under the age of 16.

[[List of Roblox games|The platform hosts millions of user-created games]] (officially referred to as "experiences"), all created using a dialect of the [[programming language]] [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]] and the platform's game engine, Roblox Studio. While Roblox is free-to-play, it features in-game purchases done through its virtual currency known as Robux, and game developers on the platform are able to create items that cost Robux. Furthermore, the platform hosts a large virtual economy centered around those items and Robux. Using the platform's "Developer Exchange" program, creators on the platform are able to exchange their earned Robux for real-world currency. The platform has also been used to host [[Virtual concert|virtual concerts]] and events, as well as [[Advergame|advergames]].

Early in Roblox{{'}}s history, it was relatively small, both as a platform and as a company. In the second half of the 2010s, the platform began to grow rapidly, and this growth was [[Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the video game industry|accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic]]. As of 2020, over 5,000 games on Roblox had been played over a million times, and over 20 had been played over one billion times. Although Roblox has been positively received by critics, it has faced heavy criticism for its [[content moderation]], [[microtransaction]]s, allegations of exploitative practices toward children, and more. The platform has been restricted or completely blocked in several countries, such as [[China]], [[Turkey]], [[Jordan]], and others.

== History and development ==
=== 2004–2009: Creation and early history ===
[[File:TechCrunch Disrupt San Francisco 2018 - day 1 (30633298878).jpg|left|thumb|Roblox co-founder David Baszucki in 2018]]
Roblox was first created in 2004 by co-founders and software engineers [[David Baszucki]] and Erik Cassel. Prior to the creation of the platform, both Baszucki and Cassel worked for Knowledge Revolution, a company that specialized in creating educational and physics simulation software. After Knowledge Revolution was acquired by [[MSC Software]], the two left the company and Baszucki began investing in earlier social media sites like [[Friendster]]. Around this time, Baszucki came up with the idea of a physics sandbox with creation tools, and a social networking aspect. Baszucki and Cassel began development on Roblox shortly afterwards, modeled after Baszucki's vision, and also created the [[Roblox Corporation]].<ref name=":12" /> Early in its development, Roblox was known as Dynablocks.<ref name=":12" /> It was determined early on in development that the two would design Roblox to rely entirely on user-generated content, only providing the tools necessary for people to develop games, as well as the server hosting.<ref name=":12" />

Baszucki and Cassel worked alone while making the earlier versions of Roblox, and created their own games on the platform before the creation tools were completed.<ref name=":12" /> These early versions of Roblox were extremely basic, with player avatars having not been animated yet and various features only being present in their most simplified form. They also advertised Roblox on some websites, leading to a few dozen players joining the platform as playtesters.<ref name=":12" /> In mid-2006, the first two employees that weren't Cassel or Baszucki were hired to work on the platform's other features. These employees were Matt Dusek and John Shedletsky, with Dusek being responsible for working on the platform's communication aspects.<ref name=":12" /> 

Roblox was officially released on September 1, 2006,<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-11-07 |title=Roblox |url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/roblox |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20250130044303/https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/roblox |archive-date=January 30, 2025 |access-date=2025-02-05 |website=[[Rock Paper Shotgun]] |language=en}}</ref> with Roblox Studio being made available that same year.<ref name=":12" /> Games that were made by the community early in the platform's history included paintball games, haunted houses, and model trains that players could ride.<ref name=":12" /> In 2008, the Roblox Corporation stopped actively creating their own games to demonstrate the platform's capabilities, becoming entirely reliant on user-created games.<ref name=":12" /> During this time in 2007, Roblox introduced the "Builders Club" membership subscription, which allowed for users to create more games under their account, sell virtual clothing, remove outside advertisements from the site, and gain Robux daily.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Shedletsky |first=John |date=August 16, 2007 |title=Builders Club is Here! |url=https://blog.roblox.com/2007/08/builders-club-is-coming |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211005094543/blog.roblox.com/2007/08/builders-club-is-here/ |archive-date=October 5, 2021 |access-date=February 10, 2025 |website=Roblox Blog}}</ref> Early in the platform's history, it had two separate currencies: Robux and Tickets, with the latter often being referred to as "Tix".<ref name=":16">{{Cite web |last=Armughanuddin |first=Md |date=2021-07-27 |title=Roblox Tix - What Is It, Is It Coming Back in 2021? |url=https://www.dualshockers.com/roblox-tix-what-is-it-is-it-coming-back-in-2021/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210927155957/https://www.dualshockers.com/roblox-tix-what-is-it-is-it-coming-back-in-2021/ |archive-date=September 27, 2021 |access-date=2025-02-03 |website=[[DualShockers]] |language=en}}</ref>

In light of the platform's newfound popularity and uses during lockdowns, Roblox introduced a new "Party Place" system, which were specific spaces that players could use to arrange meet-ups and events, such as [[Virtual concert|virtual concerts]].<ref name=":14" /> Around this time, Roblox began further working towards a vision that Baszucki described as a 30-year long plan where in which users have a "fully-fledged digital identity" in an environment such as Roblox.<ref name=":12" /> In July 2020, Baszucki formally announced plans and goals for Roblox developers and users to build a "[[metaverse]]", a concept that refers to several interconnected virtual worlds.<ref name=":30" /> As part of these plans, several other features were announced that would allow creators more freedom in their works, hoping to make them more "immersive" and making collaboration between developers easier.<ref name=":30" /> Features that were introduced around this time included Developer Events, a service that would allow creators to create and manage in-game events, and allow users to easily discover these events.<ref name=":30" /> He also announced a partnership between Roblox and record label [[Monstercat]], giving users and creators the ability to use their catalog in games.<ref name=":30" /> In August 2019, Roblox began allowing select users to upload their own accessories, a service that was later expanded to include various other types of accessories.<ref name=":18" /> 

Around this time, Roblox optimized the way that its different releases were developed over the course of 3 years, reaching a point where only a minimal amount of engineers were needed to maintain the platforms it was available on and all versions functioned off of the same APIs.<ref name=":12" /> In April 2016, Roblox became available for [[Oculus Rift]], alongside a variety of quality-of-life features made specifically for that platform.

During this time period, several features from the platform were removed. In 2016, Roblox discontinued its secondary currency, "Tickets", making Robux the platform's only currency.
